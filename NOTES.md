# Notes

(Running comments as I complete the test)

- pytest didn't find the existing test, so I added config for it in the server directory
- [node-sass is deprecated](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass), so I swapped it for [sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass)
- I added an `.nvmrc` file to pin the node version to `v16.14.0` used to build/run the project since I have multiple node versions installed. See [their GitHub repo](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for instructions on how to set it up, if needed
